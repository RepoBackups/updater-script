==============

Updater Script for Ubuntu and Debian Based Distros
Quite simple for now
I don't know where it'll go
It welcomes the user and prompts them before updating and has a self-contained UpdateLog
Added Date and Time, as well as a self building UpdateLog rather than continuously overwriting it
So you can fine what went wrong and when. Be careful as it can get rather large is you run updates often
Added some lines of >>> to make it look cleaner in the update log, everything shown on screen (almost) is in UpdateLog, save for special cases like kernel modules updating
